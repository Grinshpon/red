# RED

A vim-like terminal based text editor written in Rust

Extremely early in production. No functionality whatsoever yet.

## Red vs Vim?

Vim wins, by a long shot. Red is an editor written by someone who's never written an editor before.

Is there any advantage Red has over Vim? ...Sorta. Red is being written in Rust, using the [termion](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/termion) library. This means it should be fully compatible with the [Redox Operating System](https://www.redox-os.org/).
