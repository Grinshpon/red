A vim-like terminal based text editor written in Rust

Extremely early in production. No functionality whatsoever yet.

## Red vs Vim?

Vim wins, by a long shot. Red is an editor written by someone who's never written an editor before.

Is there any advantage Red has over Vim? ...In a certain sense, sort of, but in a different truer sense, absolutely not. Red is being written in Rust, using the [termion](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/termion) library. This means it should be fully compatible with the [Redox Operating System](https://www.redox-os.org/). Even then, you should probably be using an editor that actually works, and isn't terrible.
